# Predictive-Factors-of-US-Congressional-Bills
A statistical learning project by Anya Grytsenko and Kayley Watson analyzing the predictive factors influencing the success and passage of U.S. Congressional bills.

We chose this topic to explore the factors that contribute to the success of minority party bills in Congress. In a time of heightened political polarization, understanding these dynamics is crucial to uncovering strategies that can break through the legislative gridlocks in both the Senate and House. Specifically, we aimed to identify whether certain bill attributes—such as the number of co-sponsors, specific topics, or timing—could serve as predictors of a bill's likelihood of passing and becoming law.

After conducting a comprehensive web scraping process, we applied a combination of exploratory data visualization, Random Forest models, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to analyze patterns and draw insights. Our analysis focused on determining which variables significantly influence the passage of a bill, while also comparing different congressional periods to assess how shifting political power dynamics may affect these outcomes.
